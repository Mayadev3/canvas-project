# canvas-project
Here is a fun drawing app I created for children and young adults to enjoy. By drawing, writing and coloring on the canvas, children of all ages will be able to notice a rapid improvement in 
hand-eye coordination as they strengthen their hand muscles and become more in control of the cursor in an innovative and creative way. Those young artists can choose the color, control the thickness
of the strokes and even clear the entire canvas to start a new project.

Coding achievements:

- utilized the canvas API to draw lines and circles
- used multiple event listeners with different mouse events for drawing
- imported google fonts and embeded Giphys to create an attractive UX/UI design
